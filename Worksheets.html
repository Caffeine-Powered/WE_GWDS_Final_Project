                    This poster was designed with the radial typographic system at the forefront. As this poster is for a skate clinic, including a skateboard seemed to be a natural follow through to keep the poster on theme and to base the system around. Positioning the text around the wheel creates flow to the piece whilst keeping all the text legible. The pink/orange gradient text boxes make the font pop and separates it from the background which sits in the same light colour range that the white would be lost on otherwise. I wanted to include pink on the poster to better reference that the clinic if for girls, but I did not want to make it too overt, due to skate culture itself prominently being counterculture. Therefore, I kept the use of pink only to gradients and only on the text boxes and on the logo. The logo, which features on all the posters I have produced sits outside of the radial system, in more of an axial system with the deck of the skateboard. This piece was chosen to be iterated on, which was done by adding shadow to all the elements that feature text. One issue that became apparent is that all the colours on the poster all sit within the same brightness range, with no dark elements on the poster. Adding shadow created a contrast that makes the elements more prominent, and therefore more readable.
