            Having never done any HTML or CSS, these worksheets were a good introduction to website development, and were integral to building my own for the assessment.  

The first worksheet was a basic introduction, and the final product was simply getting a page to print a line of text. From this I learned how to set up basic html documents and where to position my code within that document. As this was more of an introductory task, it was easy and straightforward. 

The second and third worksheets were more engaging than the first as they allowed me to further develop my knowledge of HTML and introduced me to CSS. From the first worksheet I learned how to present text differently, either by using IDs for each element, such as H1 and H2 for different headings with different properties. In addition to this, it introduced lists and how to format the elements within them. Finally, it showed how to style text using functions that made text either bold, small, or italic. I found that using these functions to edit the appearance without CSS relatively simple and see how it could be used to potentially mitigate using a styles sheet. The third worksheet introduced CSS and used it to edit and format an existing webpage. This information was significant in terms of how I could apply it to my own website as I could take the principles used here and apply them to my own content. 

The fourth and fifth worksheets introduced flexbox and importing fonts from external sites such as Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts. Flexbox was useful for scaling the website to fit different devices by stacking and rearranging elements to be functional at smaller and larger sizes. Importing fonts and typefaces provides more options for displaying text and headings in tandem with using HTML functions. 

These worksheets were extremely helpful stepping into the world of HTML and CSS and were a valuable resource for building my own website. Much of the code and styling used was based off the work done in these worksheets and with aid from external references allowed me to build a more intricate website.
