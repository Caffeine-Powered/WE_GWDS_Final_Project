                        <p2>Axial typographic systems are designs that branch from a central line. They can be
                            symmetrical or asymmetrical around the central line, or axis they are based off of, allowing
                            for the creation of neat and ordered designs whilst also being able to create “messy” or more
                            unorthodox designs. </p2>

                        <img class="type-image" src="Type/Artboard 2.png" />
                        <p2>Radial typographic systems are designs that originate and revolve around a central 
                            point. These designs are useful for drawing eyes to a certain point and creataing a dynamic 
                            visual experience. </p2>
                    </div>

                <div class="typography-container2">
                        <img class="type-image" src="Type/Artboard 3.png" />
                        <p2>The dialatational typographic system expands from a centre point in a circular
                            fashion. Different parts can originate from different points allowing for multiple
                            circular designs. </p2>

                        <p2>A random typography system is elements organsied randomly. This can include elements
                            intersecting each other or being inverted to the point of illegibility. Using this system creates
                            an inherently chaotic design. </p2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="typography-container3">
                            <img class="type-image" src="Type/Artboard 5.png" />
                            <p2>The grid typographic system is elements organised into columbs and rows. This system
                                can produce very organised work, and is primarily used in articles and textbooks due
                                to its easy to navigate structure. </p2>
    
                            <img class="type-image" src="Type/Artboard 6.png" />
                            <p2>Modular typographic systems is a system that groups elements together in seperate sections.
                                This system whilst similar in nature to the grid typographic system, can be organised much more
                                free form in where the modules are placed. </p2>
                            </div>
                            <div class="typography-container4">
                                <img class="type-image" src="Type/Artboard 7.png" />
                                <p2>Transition typographic systems are much more free flowing than other systems, favouring 
                                    the design of the piece rather than the legibility. Transitional pieces don’t follow a specific
                                    axis and therefore can appear to flow together. </p2>
        
                                <img class="type-image" src="Type/Artboard 8.png" />
                                <p2>The bilateral typographic system rather simply means that the elements are centred and 
                                    symmetrical on the page. </p2>
