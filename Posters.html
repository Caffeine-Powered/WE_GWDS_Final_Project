                    This poster was designed with the radial typographic system at the forefront. As this poster is for
                    a skate clinic, including a skateboard seemed to be a natural follow through to keep the poster on
                    theme and to base the system around. Positioning the text around the wheel creates flow to the piece
                    whilst keeping all the text legible. The pink/orange gradient text boxes make the font pop and
                    separates it from the background which sits in the same light colour range that the white would be
                    lost on otherwise. I wanted to include pink on the poster to better reference that the clinic if for
                    girls, but I did not want to make it too overt, due to skate culture itself prominently being
                    counterculture. Therefore, I kept the use of pink only to gradients and only on the text boxes and
                    on the logo. The logo, which features on all the posters I have produced sits outside of the radial
                    system, in more of an axial system with the deck of the skateboard. This piece was chosen to be
                    iterated on, which was done by adding shadow to all the elements that feature text. One issue that
                    became apparent is that all the colours on the poster all sit within the same brightness range, with
                    no dark elements on the poster. Adding shadow created a contrast that makes the elements more
                    prominent, and therefore more readable.

                    This poster is the simplest of the three, designed to use the skateboards to give the poster flow
                    when being read. It incorporates the skateboarding theme by using them as text boxes the information
                    is displayed on. The colours used are identical to the first poster, using gradients from orange to
                    purple, with light blue and white being the other prominent colours. Rather than using white text in
                    boxes, this poster uses the colour in the gradient on the background as the colour for the text, so
                    it darkens with the flow if the page, turning into a purple at the bottom. The logo is the same as
                    each poster but takes up less real-estate on the page. Whilst not the poster chosen to iterate on,
                    it was edited to include some text that was initially missed when first created.

                <img id="Poster3" class="poster_image" src="Posters/GWDS_Ass1_Poster_3.jpg" />
                <p2>
                    My third poster is the most radically different of the three, using a different colour scheme, and
                    an altered version of the logo that accompanies all three. The typographic system used could be
                    argued as being both an axial system as well as a random system, although the severity of the
                    randomness is somewhat muted. The poster includes a cut out of a female skater, overlayed with both
                    a plaid pattern and cut away newspaper segments. The colours used are more saturated, with a flat
                    purple and a green, radial gradient for most of the background, being cut away by more newspaper
                    segments, like the skater. This version of the logo has the plaid pattern that covers the skater
                    replacing the gradient that the logo normally has, this better fits the skater theme as plaid is a
                    pattern that can be associated with alternative culture, which skating often falls under. The
                    medical cross has also been changed to the same purple as the lower portion of the poster as the
                    normal red clashed with the red plaid pattern of the skater. The purple on the logo also balances
                    the poster, as it is now present at both the top and bottom of the poster. The iteration done to
                    this poster is somewhat minimal, only being the shadow of the skater, giving the figure slightly
                    more depth.
