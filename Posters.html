                        This poster was designed with the radial typographic system at the forefront. As this poster is for a skate clinic, including a skateboard seemed to be a natural follow through to keep the poster on theme and to base the system around. Positioning the text around the wheel creates flow to the piece whilst keeping all the text legible. The pink/orange gradient text boxes make the font pop and separates it from the background which sits in the same light colour range that the white would be lost on otherwise. I wanted to include pink on the poster to better reference that the clinic if for girls, but I did not want to make it too overt, due to skate culture itself prominently being counterculture. Therefore, I kept the use of pink only to gradients and only on the text boxes and on the logo. The logo, which features on all the posters I have produced sits outside of the radial system, in more of an axial system with the deck of the skateboard. This piece was chosen to be iterated on, which was done by adding shadow to all the elements that feature text. One issue that became apparent is that all the colours on the poster all sit within the same brightness range, with no dark elements on the poster. Adding shadow created a contrast that makes the elements more prominent, and therefore more readable.

                    This poster is the simplest of the three, designed to use the skateboards to give the poster flow when being read. It incorporates the skateboarding theme by using them as text boxes the information is displayed on. The colours used are identical to the first poster, using gradients from orange to purple, with light blue and white being the other prominent colours. Rather than using white text in boxes, this poster uses the colour in the gradient on the background as the colour for the text, so it darkens with the flow if the page, turning into a purple at the bottom. The logo is the same as each poster but takes up less real-estate on the page. Whilst not the poster chosen to iterate on, it was edited to include some text that was initially missed when first created.
