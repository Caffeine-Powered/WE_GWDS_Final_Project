                Having started this semester with no knowledge of HTML and CSS I found that building a website was an enjoyable experience. HTML was simple to pick up, and by the end I could reliably troubleshoot issues that would arise from conflicting styling, or errors caused by adding additional elements to existing systems that did not accommodate them. CSS gave me a little bit more trouble when trying to make various parts of styling mesh, as one of the initial issues I had was the website was built on a larger monitor, which displayed the site differently when moved to my smaller monitors at home. 
            </p2>
            <p2>
                Building my website was simple to begin with, I chose to do the worksheets a second time whilst building it so I could use everything I was learning and apply it immediately. From this, I built a basic homepage that would serve as the template for the remaining pages, as I wanted to have each portion of the assessment on its own page. A colour scheme was quickly chosen to match the colour chosen for the typography section of the assessment, primarily using blacks and a wine red. I chose to reuse these colours as I found that finding a colour that complimented the red tended to clash with the colours I used on the posters, which are primarily oranges and blues. I used buttons that animated for the initial navigation, such as linking to each page, and then used dropdown menus from those buttons and anchor links to further navigate the site with more precision.  
            </p2>
            <p2>
                If I were to start again and build the website from scratch, there would be several changes I would make, primarily in the websitesâ€™ planning and when elements are added. My planning could have been more concrete in terms of what features I wanted, and what is within my skill range as a fair amount of time was spent trying to add features that I did not fully understand how to correctly implement. Time management was also an issue that arose quite quickly, partially due to trying and failing to add ambitious features, such as lightboxes and a gallery that changed images on a timer. However, the primary way I would improve my time management would be to have simply started building the site sooner as it would have given more time leeway with experimenting with features. Finally, I would have made edits to the primary navigation before populating my site with content as adding the dropdown menus to the buttons changed how the navigation elements positioned themselves on the page. 
            </p2>
            <p2>
                After finishing building my first website, I can say that whilst experiencing a reasonable amount of trial and error, I can now reliably build a semi-intricate website. Using what I have learned and how I would improve, the next step would be to build a website grander in scale, in terms of both appearance and code implementation.
