            This poster is the simplest of the three, designed to use the skateboards to give the poster flow when being read. It incorporates the skateboarding theme by using them as text boxes the information is displayed on. The colours used are identical to the first poster, using gradients from orange to purple, with light blue and white being the other prominent colours. Rather than using white text in boxes, this poster uses the colour in the gradient on the background as the colour for the text, so it darkens with the flow if the page, turning into a purple at the bottom. The logo is the same as each poster but takes up less real-estate on the page. Whilst not the poster chosen to iterate on, it was edited to include some text that was initially missed when first created.
